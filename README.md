### Hi, my name is Aishat Muibudeen (you can call me Maya üåª)  
A girl who came from a non-technical background and is now helping shape the future of open source.

---

Three years ago, I stumbled into the world of open source, unsure, overwhelmed, and with no coding skills.  
But what I *did* have was a deep desire to learn, create, and help others feel seen.

Today, I volunteer as the **Lead Design Maintainer** and **Code of Conduct Committee Member** at [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com), where I manage multiple repositories, lead inclusive design initiatives, and help uphold community values.

I also co-founded **[OpenNest-Africa](https://github.com/Open-Nest-Africa)**, a global beginner-friendly community that supports people from *any* background to contribute to open source with confidence. We create spaces, guides, and mentorship opportunities to help others start their own journeys.

### What I do?

- **Design Leadership**: Product design, UX research, and brand design for OSS projects  
- **Community Building**: Building inclusive spaces where people feel safe, seen, and supported  
- **Mentorship & Advocacy**: Helping beginners contribute, grow, and lead  
- **Public Speaking & Writing**: Sharing stories and lessons from my journey on global stages  
- **Languages**: Currently learning **German** ‚Äî *Ich kann es kaum erwarten, flie√üend zu sprechen!* üá©üá™
